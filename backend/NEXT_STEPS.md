# 🎯 Next Steps - Quick Reference

## ✅ What's Done

Phase 25 is **COMPLETE**! All autonomous features are implemented and tested:

- ✅ Interactive Confirmation Layer (safety_manager.py)
- ✅ Enhanced Semantic Analysis (semantic_analyzer.py)
- ✅ Web Search Integration (web_search.py)
- ✅ GitHub Automation (github_orchestrator.py)
- ✅ Agent Integration (14 tools, comprehensive instructions)
- ✅ Documentation (ORCHESTRATOR_GUIDE.md, QUICKSTART.md, IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)
- ✅ Testing (test_features.py - all tests passed)

## 🚀 What to Do Now

### 1. Restart Server (REQUIRED)

```bash
cd backend
python run_server.py
```

This loads the new 14 tools into the agent.

### 2. Test in VS Code (RECOMMENDED)

Open VS Code and try these commands:

**Code Analysis** (works immediately):
```
"Analyze my codebase deeply"
```

**Web Search** (needs API key):
```
"Search for async Python best practices"
```

**GitHub Operations** (git works, API needs token):
```
"Create a new branch called feature/test"
"Commit all my changes"
"Push my changes to main"
```

### 3. Configure API Keys (OPTIONAL)

If you want web search and GitHub API features, add to `backend/.env`:

```bash
# Web Search (pick one or both)
TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-xxx          # Get at https://tavily.com
EXA_API_KEY=exa-xxx              # Get at https://exa.ai

# GitHub Automation
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp-xxx             # Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens

# Safety Mode (optional)
HELIX_SAFETY_MODE=normal         # strict|normal|permissive|unsafe
```

**Without API keys**, these features still work:
- ✅ Deep semantic analysis
- ✅ Code analysis  
- ✅ Git operations (commit, push, branches)
- ✅ Safety confirmations
- ✅ File operations
- ❌ Web search (needs Tavily or Exa key)
- ❌ GitHub PR/Issue API (needs token, but git works)

## 🧪 Verify Installation

Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
cd backend
python test_features.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Safety Manager loaded
✅ Semantic Analyzer loaded
✅ Web Search Manager loaded
✅ GitHub Orchestrator loaded
✅ Agent created successfully
✅ File operations working
```
